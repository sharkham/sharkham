## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a full stack software engineer with experience in Ruby and Javascript, including Rails and React frameworks! Currently developing further skills in SQL, Postgres and CSS. My previous life includes a decade of experience in problem solving through writing, editing, critique and collaboration across many fields, from fiction and a published sociology paper to graphic novels and press releases. My blend of skills in collaboration, communication, analysis and creativity supplement my hard skills in coding. I enjoy putting my mind to a blank page and crafting something tangible and useful.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on updating and deploying my PokÃ©mon size comparison JavaScript app!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with figuring out how to let users save an image of multiple elements on a page (like a screenshot) using VanillaJS
